          <span class="color-changing">Machine learning</span>
          is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves the use of algorithms
          and statistical models to enable machines to learn from data,
          make decisions, and improve their performance on a specific task over time.

      <p>
  In traditional programming,
  algorithms are written to perform specific tasks with a set of predetermined rules.
  In contrast, machine learning algorithms are designed
  to learn from data and improve their performance based on the data they are trained on.
  This allows machines to perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible to program manually,
  such as <span class="color-changing"> image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics

      <h3 class="title">What can machine learning do? </h3>
      <div style="font-size: 20px; ">
    It can be said that ML attempts to achieve functions similar to the learning ability of humans on a computer.
    ML attempts to mimic the learning ability of humans by using algorithms and statistical models to analyze data
    and make predictions or decisions based on patterns and trends in the data.
